# Flappy Box

Flappy Box originally was a creative project I made in sophomore year of high school. Back in sophomore year, my programming teacher assigned us a creative GUI project where we could do anything we wanted provided we include a few GUI components like buttons, text fields, and etc. Being me, I decided to create "Flappy Box", a parody of the famous game "Flappy Bird". After looking through my old HS flash drive, I decided to revamp my old project, remove the required components, and put this up on my GitHub. 

Please be mindful that most of this code was written when I was a sophomore in high school and doesn't necessarily represent my current coding ability. You will see some pieces of code that aren't conventional, sloppy, and/or inefficient. The game still runs fine for now so I'll let the code sit as is. Still, I do plan on coming back to this project to clean up my old code and add fun new features.

## To-Do

* Add comments to undocumented parts of my code
* Clean up my code and re-fit it for standard OOP conventions
* Add feature: high scores
* Add feature: sounds
